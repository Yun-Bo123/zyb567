**Data Introduction**

The Puromycin dataset shows how an enzyme’s reaction rate changes with different concentrations of a substance. There are two groups in the data: one group was treated, and the other wasn’t. By looking at this data, we can see how treatment affects the reaction speed.

**How I made the plot**

I used R’s ggplot2 package to make the graph. First, I put concentration on the x-axis and reaction rate on the y-axis. Then, I used different colors to show the treated and untreated groups, so we can easily compare them. I added points to show the actual data and connected points with lines to see the trend clearly.
